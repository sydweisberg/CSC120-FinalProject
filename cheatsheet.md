- All commands in my game do not require any additional inputs than what it directly listed. If there is a number, you must input a number, if there is no number, you can input anything. String inputs are only required when initially entering your name and when completing the typing minigame in the mine.

- The Wizard Tower is a fun unlockable area with a unique minigame that can only be accessed if you purchase the "Glider" item for 500 CSCs (game currency) in the Unusual Shop located in Market Town

# SPOILER ALERT

- There is no "direct" way to win the game. I wanted to make the game endless. However... the crown is quite an expensive item, and might reward you with a special message if you obtain it ;)

- The fastest way to obtain the "Crown" item is by going to the mine until you earn at least 530 CSCs, then buying the "Glider" item at the shop, going to the Wizard Tower, playing Tic Tac Toe and doubling your money each time until you earn enough money to buy the "Crown"
